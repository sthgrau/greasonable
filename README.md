Originally developed in chrome with tampermonkey..
Also tested with pale moon with greasemonkey..

Features:
Ability to go back to the last 5 refresh times in case you accidentally refresh before finishing.
Thread hiding (or at least adapted for reason).
Some basic filtering (whole message for now) which auto hides threads
that match, not just individual messages.. (this is the main thing I wanted)
Simple editor for filters
Reformatting the date strings and added support for your local time.
Youtube inline.
Alt-text for story pictures..
Plus whatever the source script did: highlighting new comments, adding floating bar to jump to new comments.
Works in both Firefox and Chrome (at least).. if I can get user-scripts to work on others, I will test them too...


Using the below method (vs method posted 2/28/2015 in comments) will allow greasemonkey to update for you


Firefox install:

Install greasemonkey using add-on manager.
Go to: https://github.com/sthgrau/greasonable/raw/master/reason.user.js
This should prompt you to install in greasemonkey
That should be it, just reload..

Chrome install:

Install tampermonkey using extensions manager.
Go to: https://github.com/sthgrau/greasonable/raw/master/reason.user.js
This should prompt you to install in greasemonkey
